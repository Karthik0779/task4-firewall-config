# Windows Firewall Report – Task 4

I used Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Settings to manage traffic rules.

1. Opened firewall via:
   Run → wf.msc

2. Viewed Inbound Rules.

3. Created a new rule:
   - Port: TCP 23 (Telnet)
   - Action: Block the connection
   - Profile: All
   - Name: Block Telnet

4. Tested using:
   telnet localhost 23
   → Connection refused (success)

5. Created allow rule for port 22 (SSH)

6. Deleted Telnet block rule after test

This helped me understand rule-based control of network access and GUI-based firewall management in Windows.
