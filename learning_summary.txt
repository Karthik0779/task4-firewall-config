# Learning Summary â€“ Task 4
## Windows Firewall & Linux UFW Firewall Configuration

I performed firewall configuration tasks on both Windows and Kali Linux. This helped me understand how to control traffic and protect systems by managing port rules.

---

## Windows Firewall
- Blocked port 23 (Telnet) using GUI
- Tested using Telnet client
- Allowed port 22 (SSH)
- Deleted test rule to restore firewall

## Kali Linux (UFW)
- Installed and enabled UFW
- Denied port 23 (Telnet)
- Tested using telnet command
- Allowed port 22 (SSH)
- Removed the Telnet rule

## Key Skills Learned
- Using GUI and CLI to manage firewall
- Importance of blocking insecure ports (Telnet)
- How to safely configure port-based rules
- Testing rule effectiveness using Telnet
- Understanding of inbound/outbound filtering

This task gave me hands-on experience with practical firewall management on both OS environments.
